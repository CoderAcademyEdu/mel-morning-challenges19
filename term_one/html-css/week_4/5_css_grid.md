### CSS Grid 

Today we'll be covering CSS grid. We won't spend heaps of time on it so I'm giving you some extra time this morning to study what it is before we look at it in class.

Sign up for this [CSS grid Wes Bos course](https://cssgrid.io/) and code along to the first few videos. You won't have time to get through all of the content today but it'll be an excellent resource for CSS grid if you need more help.

If you would like some extra ruby practice please complete the following exercise https://github.com/CoderAcademy-MEL/ruby-fundamentals-path/blob/master/4_ruby_drills_B.rb
