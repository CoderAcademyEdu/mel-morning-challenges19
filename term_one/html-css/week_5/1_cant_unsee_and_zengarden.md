## Challenges

### Can't Unsee

Building upon what you learnt last week with Figma, try to get a high score on this [design challenge game](https://cantunsee.space/).

### Zengarden

This is the challenge we'll be completing [throughout all of today](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Read through the documentation and look at some of the examples before you make a start.

There is some more documentation about it [under challenge 10 the day we did flexbox](https://github.com/CoderAcademy-MEL/html-css-challenges/blob/master/03-flexbox.md#challenge-10).
