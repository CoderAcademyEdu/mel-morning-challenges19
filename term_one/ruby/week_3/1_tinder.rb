# Core

# The year is 2025, and Tinder is running the world. Create a method, that will take an array of 5 names, entered by the user, and will use a ruby method to print out a random person from the array that the user has been matched with

# Advanced

# Add in functionality to allow the user to pick ‘yes’ or ’no’ to their match. If they pick ‘yes’, give them a congratulatory message telling them who their date is. If they say no, chose another person from the array. Eventually, if there is no one left in the array, let the user know that they have run out of swipes
