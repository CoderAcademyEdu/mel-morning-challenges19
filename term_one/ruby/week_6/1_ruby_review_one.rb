# **Core:**

# **1.** Print out how old you are in seconds

# **2.** Create a method called highest_number that takes in two numbers and returns the higher of the two

# **3.** Create a method that takes a number as input and returns "This is a prime number", if its a prime number, else, "This is not a prime number"

# **4.** Prompt the user to enter their name. If its longer than 7 letters, return "By golly, thats a long name!", otherwise return, "Hi there new friend"

# **5.** Create a method that takes a string, and returns the amount of vowels in that string. *E.g* If the string "How many vowels" is passed through, the method will return "There are 4 vowels in this word"

# **6.** Create a method that will take a 24hr timestamp as an integer (e.g. 9AM will be 0900, 3:35PM will be 1535) and, using conditional logic, if its:

# ```
# * before 12noon - return its morning
# * between 12noon and 1PM - return its lunchtime
# * between 1PM and 5PM - return arvo blues
# * between 5PM and 6PM - return happy hour
# * between 6PM and 8PM - return dinner time
# * between 8PM to Midnight - return bedtime
# * past midnight (i.e. 2400 or over) - return thats not a valid 24hr time
# ```

# *Try this with both if/elsif/else and case statements!*

# **7.** Create a hash of what you ate yesterday (i.e. {breakfast: "oats", lunch: "curry" ... }). Loop through this hash, and print out what you ate yesterday!

# **8.** Create a block that will print out all even numbers between 1 and 20

# **9.** Create a method that will greet a user dynamically, based on time. It will first ask for their name, then, if its before noon, it will say "Good morning, < name >!", otherwise it will say "Good afternoon, < name >!"

# **10.** Create a method that will take in a non-negative integer, and will return the highest possible number
# * *E.g.* If the input was 4847291, it will return 9874421

# **11.** Create a method that will take a multi-word string as input, and returns that same string, with each word capitalized. 
# * *E.g.* If the input was "tHIs IS a MuLTi wORd STiNG", should return "This Is A Multi Word String"
