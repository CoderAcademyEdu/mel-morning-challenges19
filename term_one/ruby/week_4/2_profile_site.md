## Background & Objectives

A simple challenge to manipulate basic HTML tags and create a profile page with headers/texts/lists/images/tables.

## Specs

Build a simple HTML page with the following elements (use the right HTML tags):

- an image of yourself
- a header and sub-header with your name and position
- a description of yourself
- a list of your social links

A picture is worth a thousand words, [here is what you should build in this challenge](https://lewagon.github.io/html-css-challenges/01-profile-content-new/)

## Tips & Resources

- You can use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to find nice icons (e.g. for social networks). It is a very convenient library since it is a **font** of icons (hence it will be very easy to resize these icons, change their color, and add animations on them!)
- Don't forget the page `<title>` in the `<head>` section, and other important metatags like `<meta charset="utf-8">`.
- You could use the `_target="blank"` attribute on your links to make them open on new tabs.
