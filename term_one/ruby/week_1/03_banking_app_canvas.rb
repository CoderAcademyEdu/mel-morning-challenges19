# Let the user determine the output. Ask them what they would like to do. If they type balance and hit return, show them their balance! Currently the only option is balance.
# If the user types anything other than balance, say "Invalid selection!"
# Ask the user for a password before proceeding

# Add 'deposit' as an option. If they select it, ask 'how much would you like to deposit?'. Update the balance and show it back to the user.
# Wrap the program in a loop so the user can view balance and then deposit over and over.
# The screen's looking pretty ugly, figure out how to clear the screen between loops.
# Implement a withdraw feature. Make sure they can't withdraw more than their total balance.
# Research arrays. Store each transaction in an array and then implement a 'history' option.
# Restarting the app sets the balance to $0. Research reading/writing files. Store the balance in a text file so it persists.
# Research hashes. Store multiple user balances and histories in a hash.
