# you are working at a bar where you have a current backlog of drinks to make:
#  3 party parrot cocktails
# 2 party parrot waters
# and
# 6 party parrot beers

# write a program that asks the customer for their order.
# if they order a party parrot cocktail, add one to the number of party parrot cocktails you need to make,
# if they order a party parrot water, add one to the number of party parrot waters you need to make,
# if they order a party parrot beer, add one to the number of party parrot beers you need to pour

# print the final drinks order so you know what to make

# cocktails sell for $22, and cost $8 to make
# beer sell for $12, and cost $3 to pour
# water sell for $6, and cost $0.15 to make

# print out the total profit for the orders you have
