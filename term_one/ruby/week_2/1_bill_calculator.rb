# A group of friends have just finished lunch. Write method to work out how much each person owes.

# - Your app should ask "Enter a customer's name"- Your first line of code is:
# items = [
#     {
#         customer: "John",
#         item: "Soup",
#         cost: 8.50
#     },
#     {
#         customer: "Sarah",
#         item: "Pasta",
#         cost: 12
#     },
#     {
#         customer: "John",
#         item: "Coke",
#         cost: 2.50
#     }
# ]

# - Your app should output, for example: "John owes $11.0"

## Beast
# Format your total so it always shows two decimal places, e.g. $11.00
# Allow items to be added to the list. E.g. "Press 1 to add items, press 2 to work out a total".
