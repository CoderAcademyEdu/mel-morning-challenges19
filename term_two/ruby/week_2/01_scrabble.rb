## Morning Challenge

# The year is 2021, and theres been a new version of scrabble created. This version is much more simple. The points are scored according to the letters position in the alphabet. a = 1. b = 2, c = 3....etc. With the highest word winnning that round.
# Create a method that will receive a string of one or many words, and returns the highest scoring word. 
# If two words score the same, return the one that appears first.
# You will only receive downcase alphanumeric characters (a-z).
# * **E.g.** word_ranking('hi there') -> 'there'
# *Explanation* 'hi' is worth 17, as 'there' is worth 56, so return 'there'
