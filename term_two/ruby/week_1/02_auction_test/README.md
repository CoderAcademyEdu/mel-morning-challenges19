# Rspec Auction item challange
In the project directory auction_test, you'll find a spec directory which has a few tests written for you. What you'll have to do is write the AuctionItem class and keep adding code to create and implement methods until all the tests pass. The file `auction_item.rb` has been created for you, just put the code inside of that file.

## To run all the tests run this command from your terminal from the project directory: `rspec spec`

# Beast
- Add more values to AuctionItem such as owner_name, purchase_date etc. For each one
  - add the test 
  - add the implementation
  - use Faker to make the data
