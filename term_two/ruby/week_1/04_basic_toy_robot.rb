# in this challenge we'll be implementing a basic version of the toy robot challenge

# watch this video to see the end product i'd like you to achieve https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-xmoKu4SUw&feature=youtu.be

# given this array

table = [
  [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
  [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
  [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
  [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
  [" ", " ", " ", " ", " "],
]

# place our robot "ðŸ¤–" on the table using gets.chomp for the X, Y position

# using a while loop allow the user to choose whether they want to move north, south, east or west (again using gets.chomp)

# allow the user to quit (end the loop) or keep playing the game

# optional

# ensure that a user can't go out of the 5 by 5 bounds of the board

# handle all edge cases with user input

# consider using a Robot class to implement the same logic
