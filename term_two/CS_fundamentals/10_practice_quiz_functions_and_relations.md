### Relations

1. Given:
```
A = { (x,y) ϵ N | x - y = 0 }
```
is A a reflexive relationship?


2. Given the following matrix:
```
[ [  1  3  5 ]
  [  3 10  6 ]
  [  5  6 54 ] ]
```
What relationship does this demonstrate?  What properties of this matrix are mandatory to allow this relationship?


3. Is the set B demonstrating a symmetric relationship?
```
B = { (f,e), (a,b), (c,d), (d,c), (e,f) (b,a) }
```

4. What set of values is demonstrated by the following set notation:
```
D = { x ϵ R | x = x² }
```


5. Write out set notation that could fit the following range:
```
[ 0, 2, 8, 26 ]
```
