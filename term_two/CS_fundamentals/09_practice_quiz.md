### Binary search vs linear

You're asked to guess a number between 1 and 50 that your teacher is thinking of. 

1. What's the maximum possible guesses it would take to find this number using linear search? Whats the time complexity? 

2. What's the maximum possible guesses it would take to find this number using binary search? Whats the time complexity?

### Optimizing algorithms

1. There is a set A of n numbers that are unsorted. There is a set B of n numbers that are unsorted. You want to write a function to merge these two sets together to ensure that you return one sorted set. Is there a faster way than O(n<sup>2</sup>)? If so, describe how it would work and what the Big O would achieve? 

For the following questions you're in this real life situation: you are given a phone book (like the yellow pages), the phone book has businesses which have unique names. The names are sorted by alphabetical order.  

2. Your boss tells you to find the phone number of "Coder Academy". They say the phone number is on page 102. Is there a faster way to find the phone number than O(n)? If so, describe how it would work? 

3. Your boss tells you to find "Coder Academy" again but this time you're just given the business name. Is there a faster way to find the phone number than O(log n)? If so, describe how it would work?

  index = 0
  while index < items.length - 1
    if items[index] == match
     return index
    end 
    index += 1
  end 
  return -1 
end 
```

3. What is the time complexity of the following code in Big O?

```rb 
def build_square_matrix(items)
  matrix = []
  index_one = 0
  index_two = 0
  while indexOne < items.length - 1
    matrix[indexOne] = []
    indexOne += 1
    while indexTwo < items.length - 1
      matrix[indexOne].push(items[indexTwo])
      indexTwo += 1
    end 
  end 
  return matrix 
end
```

### Optimizing code

    if item == num
      found_num = item
    end
  end 
  if !found_num
    return 'num not in array'
  else 
    return found_num
  end 
end

result = find_num_in_array(1, [3, 1, 5])
```

2. If you were to make a change to improve the code, what change would you make? What would be the time complexity after the change?

```rb
def is_num_in_array(num, arr)
  middle_index = arr.length / 2
  if arr[middle_index] == num 
    return true
  end 
  if middle_index == 0 
    if num == arr[middle_index]
      return true
    else 
      return false
    end 
  end 
  if num < arr[middle_index]
    arr.slice!(middle_index..(arr.length - 1))
  else 
    arr.slice!(0..middle_index)
  end 
  is_num_in_array(num, arr)
end

result = is_num_in_array(4, [1,2,3,4,5,6])
```


3. If you were to make a change to improve the code, what change would you make? What would be the time complexity after the change?

```rb
arr_of_arrays = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,6,7,8]
]

def is_num_in_arrays(passed_int, arr_of_arrays)
  arr_of_arrays.each do |array|
    array.each do |int|
      if int == passed_int
        return true
